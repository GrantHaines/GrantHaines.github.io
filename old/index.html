			<h1>Welcome</h1>
			<p>Hello! My name is Grant Haines, and I am currently a second-year Computer Science student at Oregon State University. I have created this website to practice my web development skills and to serve as a platform for my career. Read below for a brief biography of myself, and go to my blog to read what I think about things.</p>
			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I was born in April 1999 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and spent the first 12 years of life living in New Mexico, most of which were spent in a small town named Tucumcari. In 2012, my family and I moved north to Hillsboro, Oregon, where I still live today. I was homeschooled through most of middle school and high school, but began taking classes at Portland Community College in the 11th grade. In 2017 I enrolled at Oregon State University to study Computer Science, in the Degree Partnership Program, which means I am still living in Hillsboro, taking about half my classes at PCC, and the other half online at OSU. I plan on moving to Corvallis to study at Oregon State full-time in 2019.</p>
			<p>That's some of my personal history, but it doesn't really tell you a whole lot about who I am. Visually, I am about 6'2" tall, medium-length brown hair, brown eyes, almost-but-not-really skinny, bedecked with glasses, and typically wearing some combination of jeans and a t-shirt, though it doesn't take too much for me to dress up. I am a Christian, currently a member of the Sunset church of Christ in Hillsboro, Oregon, though I will probably begin attending somewhere else once I move down to Corvallis.</p>
			<p>Once I finish with my degree, I intend on pursuing a career as a software developer, working "hands-on" with coding and learning the ins-and-outs of software development. I would like to enter MECOP (an engineering internship placement program) while at OSU, where I can gain some hard experience in the field before moving on to get my degree.</p>
