		<h1 class="projectListTitle">Skills</h1>
		<p class="aboutText">I have experience with a number of programming languages and styles, as well as with various types of hardware and software.</p>

		<h2 class="skillTitle"></h2>

		<h2 class="skillTitle">Collaborative Tools</h2>
		<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>Git/GitHub</span> I have used Git and GitHub for many projects, both individually and with a group. I am familiar with forking, branches, and tags/releases.</p>
		<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>Kanban</span> During a group project in my CS361 (Software Engineering I) course, we used Kanban board software to manage our tasks and track our group's progress. While I do not think we used it to it's full potential, with only 4 people, I did learn a great deal about project management in the process.</p>
		<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>Agile</span> Most of my group projects have used the Agile development method to some extent, including my ongoing senior capstone project.</p>

		<h2 class="skillTitle">Programming Languages</h2>
		<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>C/C++</span> Most of my early programming experience was in C and C++, and I have continued to use it since for numerous programming projects and assignments of varying scale. Notably, these include the small shell and spaceship escape game listed in my projects above.</p>
		<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>C#</span> I learned C# in the course of working on the Aeternitas Station game project mentioned above. Although that is the only work I have done with it, the project was substantial in size and it is similar enough to C and C++ that I feel very confident with it.</p>
		<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>Python</span> I have used Python in the creation of a large number of smaller scripts, especially for statistical analysis, but have not created any sizable programs with it.</p>
		<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>JavaScript</span> My experience in JavaScript is limited mainly to web development, either with the NodeJS framework or for client-side web page interaction.</p>
		<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>Java</span> I have used Java in a couple of smaller projects and have a general knowledge, but am not intimately familiar with it.</p>
		<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>Assembly </span> I have some experience programming with basic assembly language on an AVR Microcontroller, and have studied the syntax of AT&T x86 assembly.</p>
		<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>Haskell </span> I have spent some time learning the basic concepts of Haskell and functional programming in general, but most of my experience in using it is with small demo programs.</p>
		<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>Prolog </span> Like Haskell, I have studied the basic concepts of Prolog and logical programming languages, but do not have extensive experience with using it in practice.</p>

		<h2 class="skillTitle">Hardware and Software</h2>
		<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>MySQL </span> I have a great deal of experience using MySQL in relation to web development. I have created multiple websites for university courses as well as the Sunset Church of Christ website listed above using MySQL databases.</p>
		<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>FPGA's</span> I have a small amount of experience programming a Field Programmable Gate Array (the DE10-Lite) using schematic design and SystemVerilog (a hardware description language), implementing both combinational and sequential logic. In my projects listed above, you can find a design project I participated in using an FPGA.</p>
		<!--<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>AVR Microcontrollers</span> </p>-->
		<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>IDE's</span> I have used numerous IDE's, editors, and compilers, including Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, NotePad++, MinGW (C/C++ compiler), IntelliJ Idea, Eclipse, and Codeblocks.</p>
		<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>Unix</span> The engineering servers at OSU, which I have used for almost all of my Computer Science courses, run on Unix. I am familiar with navigating and using the Unix file system, including Bash scripting. I have also programmed on Unix using Vim, though I mostly prefer an IDE as listed just above.</p>
