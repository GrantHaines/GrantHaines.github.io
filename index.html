			<h1 class="projectListTitle">Skills</h1>
			<p class="sectionDesc">I have experience with a number of programming languages, frameworks, and methodologies, as well as with various types of hardware and software.</p>
			
			<div class="sectionBox" id="skillBox">
				<div class="sectionSubBox">
					<h2 class="skillTitle">Collaborative Tools</h2>
					<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>Git/GitHub</span> I have used Git and GitHub for many projects, both individually and with a group. I am familiar with the standard Git and GitHub features such as commits, forking, branches, pull requests, and tags/releases. I have also used GitLab at various times as an alternative to GitHub.</p>
					<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>Kanban</span> I have used Kanban-method project-management tools in many of my team development projects. The application we have used most often for this is Trello, which I also use for organizing my own solo projects.</p>
					<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>Agile</span> Most of my group projects have used the Agile development method to some extent, most notably my senior capstone project, where we had tri-weekly standup meetings and worked in organized sprints. For organization in that project, we used Jira to manage our backlog and sprint progress.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sectionSubBox">
					<h2 class="skillTitle">Programming Languages</h2>
					<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>JavaScript</span> I have considerable experience using JavaScript for web development. This ranges from basic client-side scripts and DOM manipulation to writing complete front-end or back-end applications using frameworks like React JS and Express.</p>
					<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>TypeScript</span> While I have only recently (as of 2021) started learning TypeScript and switching to it from JavaScript in most of my projects, I am a huge fan of it and was able to pick it fairly quickly based on my JS experience.</p>
					<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>C/C++</span> Most of my early programming experience was in C and C++, and I have continued to use it since for numerous programming projects and assignments of varying scale. Notably, these include the small shell and spaceship escape game listed in my projects above.</p>
					<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>C#</span> I learned C# creating some prototype roguelike games using the <a class="link" href="http://sadconsole.com/index.html">SadConsole library</a>. I have also experimented with using C# and WinForms to create client applications on Windows.</p>
					<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>Python</span> I have used Python in the creation of a large number of smaller scripts, and in my senior capstone project as our main back-end server language.</p>
					<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>Java</span> I have used Java only sparingly in most contexts, but do have some extended experience doing Android development in Java.</p>
					<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>Assembly</span> I have some experience programming with basic assembly language on an AVR Microcontroller, and have studied the syntax of AT&T x86 assembly.</p>
					<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>Haskell</span> I have spent some time learning the basic concepts of Haskell and functional programming in general, but most of my experience in using it is with small demo programs.</p>
					<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>Prolog</span> Like Haskell, I have studied the basic concepts of Prolog and logical programming languages, but do not have extensive experience with using it in practice.</p>
					</div>
				<div class="sectionSubBox">
					<h2 class="skillTitle">Development Frameworks</h2>
					<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>React</span> My senior capstone team at OSU used React JS as our front-end framework for building the Agile Release Compliance Tracker application. Although I only worked on a few aspects of that side of the project toward the end of the development process, I have since spent time learning React by creating some experimental web applications.</p>
					<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>Node.js</span> Almost all of my advanced web development experience (beyond basic HTML/CSS) has been done using Node.js. I have created many web servers using Express, including simple database APIs and full websites with the Express-Handlebars templating engine.</p>
					<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>Flask</span> In my senior capstone project, we used the Python Flask server framework to create our back-end REST API. I was one of the primary developers of this side of the project, so I gained considerable experience in Flask, Python, and RESTful APIs in general.</p>
					<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>Godot</span> Godot is an open-source game engine which I used to create the Echo_Location game listed above in my projects. For my project, I use Godot's built-in scripting language called GDScript, which is very similar to Python in syntax and function.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sectionSubBox">
					<h2 class="skillTitle">Hardware and Software</h2>
					<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>MySQL</span> I have a great deal of experience using MySQL in relation to web development. I have created multiple websites for university courses as well as the Sunset Church of Christ website listed above using MySQL databases.</p>
					<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>Android</span> I spent several months at Oregon State University learning how to develop Android applications in Java, including the use of web API's and SQLite.</p>
					<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>FPGA's</span> I have a small amount of experience programming a Field Programmable Gate Array (the DE10-Lite) using schematic design and SystemVerilog (a hardware description language), implementing both combinational and sequential logic. In my projects listed above, you can find a design project I participated in using an FPGA.</p>
					<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>AVR Microcontrollers</span> I spent a term of study at Oregon State programming an AVR microcontroller using both C and assembly code. This included programming an LCD display, using system interrupts, and simulating a remote controlled vehicle using a USART module.</p>
					<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>IDE's</span> I have used numerous IDE's, editors, and compilers, including Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, NotePad++, MinGW (C/C++ compiler), IntelliJ Idea, Eclipse, and Codeblocks.</p>
					<p class="skillItem"><span class="skillName">>Unix</span> The engineering servers at OSU, which I have used for almost all of my Computer Science courses, run on Unix. I am familiar with navigating and using the Unix system, including Bash scripting. I have also programmed on Unix using Vim, though I mostly prefer an IDE as listed above.</p>
