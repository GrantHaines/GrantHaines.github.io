						<p class="blogDate">September 18, 2018</p>
						<div class="blogText">
							<p>I got back to working on this website finally. I decided to revamp the style to look a little more modern with less defined borders and stuff. I also added a sidebar to this blog page. I learned recently that GitHub Pages doesn't allow you to use CMS, so that will probably kill at least the blog part of this for now. I've also added a currently commented-out image carousel to the front page that I am working on, though I don't have any good pictures to use it with. I might just delete it and stick with a regular image.</p>

						<p class="blogTitle">On Making a Website</p>
						<p class="blogDate">August 22, 2018</p>
						<div class="blogText">
							<p>Today I started working on my personal website. I've gotten a homepage with a short biography and some links to other websites I've made, along with this blog page that I am writing this on. Below this used to be (and may still be) a test post that I wrote to make sure it works. In a way, this is also a test post to see how it looks with multiple posts.</p>
							<p>Hopefully this personal website thing works out. I don't know if I will keep doing it as raw HTML/CSS like I am now, or move to a Content Management System like Wordpress. I like doing it manually because it tests my skills, and I personally enjoy doing it, but a CMS would probably look a lot better. If you are reading this in the future, of course, you already know what I chose to do. If I did it wrong, tell me so I can fix it, otherwise try not to break it. Here is a picture of the site for posterity, and to test images:</p>

							<p>That's it for now, got to go eat dinner. It might turn out that this website doesn't go anywhere after this, but maybe it will turn out ok.</p>

						<p class="blogTitle">Test Post</p>
						<p class="blogDate">August 22, 2018</p>
						<div class="blogText">
							<p>This is a test of the blog post system. There is no database or anything, just some divs in an HTML file. I hope you find this information interesting because I need to write something here for filler, and hoping if it was interesting takes a lot of words to write, like so.</p>
							<p>This is another paragraph, because I need to test if it works. Again, I need a bunch of filler here so that I can test this thoroughly. I am too lazy to use a Lorem Ipsum generator so I am just going to keep writing until I run out of things to say. Nice weather today, but it's a little smoky. It looks like it is starting to cool off from all the heat we've had this summer. That's all I'm going to write.</p>
